        <!--   <p><br>
               <strong>Q: How long does a phone screen repair take?</strong><br>
               A: If parts are available and the phone was dropped off before 4pm, it should be done on the same business day.<br>
               <br>
               <strong>Q: How much will my repair cost?</strong><br>
               A: Check out our Estimate / Quote section in the toolbar above.<br>
               <br>
               <strong>Q: Do you do mail-in repairs?</strong><br>
               A: At the moment we currently do not accept mail-in orders due to USPS / FedEx delivery issues.<br>
               <br>
               <strong>Q: Can you unlock iCloud locked devices?</strong><br>
               A: Without the iCloud email and password associated with the device, nobody can unlock it -- not even Apple.<br>
               <br>
               <strong>Q: My device was water damaged, but it's been more than 24 hours. Can it still be repaired?</strong><br>
               A: No. Corrosion has already gotten too deep into the phone.<br>
               <br>
               <strong>Q: What are your business hours?</strong><br>
               A: Our business hours are listed under the About page in the toolbar above.<br>

                <strong>Q: How long does a phone screen repair take?</strong>
                <div>
                    <p>A: If parts are available and the phone was dropped off before noon, it should be done on the same business day.<br>
                        If parts are not available, please allow 5-7 business days.</p>

                <strong>Q: Do you do mail-in repairs?</strong>
                <div>
                    <p>A: At the moment we currently do not accept mail-in orders due to USPS / FedEx delivery issues.</p>

                <strong>Q: Can you unlock iCloud locked devices?</strong>

                    <p>A: No. Without the iCloud email and password associated with the device, nobody can unlock it -- not even Apple.</p>

                <strong>Q: My device was water damaged, but it's been more than 24 hours. Can it still be repaired?</strong>
                <div>
                    <p>A: No. Corrosion has already gotten too deep into the phone, even if not physically present right
                        away. It could take several months before the corrosion takes over if the device wasn't treated
                        by a professional within 24 hours. Putting the phone in rice does not count as "treated by a professional" - it is actively corroding.</p>

                <strong>Q: Do you price match?</strong>
                <div>
                    <p>A: We will do our best to match competitors. If we cannot beat their price, we advise you to use them!</p>
